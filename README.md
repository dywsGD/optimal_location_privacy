# Optimal Location Privacy
The linear programs to obtain the optimal obfuscation mechanism to protect location privacy against adaptive inference attacks

This is based on the algorithms proposed in the following paper:

Shokri, Reza and Theodorakopoulos, George and Troncoso, Carmela and Hubaux, Jean-Pierre and Le Boudec, Jean-Yves, 'Protecting location privacy: optimal strategy against localization attacks', in Proceedings of the ACM conference on computer and communications security (CCS) 2012.

The AdversaryStrategy.m computes the optimal strategy for the inference attack, and the UserStrategy.m computes the optimal strategy for the mobile user.
